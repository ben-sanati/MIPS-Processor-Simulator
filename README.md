# Computer Architecture CW - MIPS Processor Simulator 

## Description

This project, is a computer engineering module CW, set in second year of university. A MIPS ISA single-instruction, multi-cycle processor simulator was created in C++ using CLion.

## Functionality

** TBD ** 

## Run

1) Boot-up CLion
2) Open the **CMakeCache.txt** file as a project
```
Open -> CompEngCw/CMakeCache.txt -> OK -> Open as Project
```
3) Select the assembly program file location you want to the simulator to use in line 13 of the **Translator.cpp** file
4) Run the program
```
Method 1: Alt + Shift + F10, then press Enter on the CompEngCw config
Method 2: Run -> Run... -> press Enter on the CompEngCw config
```
